    "## Syllabus\n",
    "\n",
    "The course introduces the main concepts and techniques of data mining (DM) and information retrieval (IR). It covers a variety of data mining topics and methods to extract hidden and predictive patterns from large data collections. Furthermore, theory and techniques for the modeling, indexing, and retrieval of relational, non-relational, text-based and multimedia databases is covered. Topics include introduction to data mining process, mining frequent patterns, and pattern analysis, as well as different information retrieval models and evaluation, query languages and operations, indexing/searching methods, and recommender systems.\n",

    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon successful completion of this course students will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Understand basic concepts, principles, and methods in data mining and information retrieval as well as obtain hands-on experience using data mining and information retrieval toolkits tailored for big data and clouds\n",
    "2. Apply various document analytics methods including traditional (e.g. clustering and classification) and advanced (e.g., topic modeling and sentiment analysis) to various data sets, especially to textual data\n",
    "3. Recall important pattern discovery concepts, methods, and applications, in particular, the basic concepts of pattern discovery, such as frequent pattern, closed pattern, max-pattern, and association rules.\n",
    "4. Learn the underlying technologies of classical and modern information retrieval system\n",
    "5. Understand basic concepts and methods of recommender systems"
